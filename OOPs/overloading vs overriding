OverLoading rules

1. Name of method should be same in each of the classes.
2. Return type and method argument can vary in each classes.
3. Inheritance is not necessary.


OverRiding rules
1. Inheritance is required b/w parent and child classes.
2. Method argument and return type must be same in both the class's method
3. @Override annotation check if method is not overridden/implemented from it's superclass during complilation
4. The access modifier of subclass method should be same or wider than superclass's access modifier
5. If superclass throws error then subclass can either throw same,subclass of that error or no error
6. If superclass throws no error then subclass can only declare unchecked exceptions

private vs final (OverRiding)- 
1. final method of superclass gives 'method final' error in compile time
2. private method of superclass gives no error rather it runs the local method
	using annotation in such cases gives no overriding done error
   When we create object/call of private then we get error
